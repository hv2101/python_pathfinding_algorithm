# Pathfinding Visualization for A* Algotihm in Python

<p>A* algorithm is a searching algorithm that is used to find the shortest distance between two points. It uses heuristic evaluation to find the shortest route to the given point.</p>
<br>
<p>Used pygame library for visualizing the animation of the shortest path.</p>
<br>
#### Steps to use
<br>
<p>Use first two left clicks to mark the starting and ending points on the cubes.</p>
<p>After that use the left clicks to mark the obstacle that will block the path for algorithm to find out shortest path between the starting and ending point.</p>
<p>Right click can be used to erase any marked cubes.</p>
<br>
<p>Use keyboard button Spacebar to start the pathfinding and C button to clear everything on the page.</p>
